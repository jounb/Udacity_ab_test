        "\n",
        "* If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they are able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they do not receive the paid benefits (e.g. coaching support, verified certificate)\n",

        " * If the student chooses  5 + hours per week, they are taken through the checkout process as usual. \n",
        " * If they choose < 5 hours per week, a message would say that Udacity courses usually need more time for completion, and suggest accessing the course materials for free. Then, the student would have the option to continue enrolling, or access free course instead.
