# Udacity A/B Test

This analysis uses an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. The specific numbers have been changed but the patterns have not. The experiment overview, metric defintions, and data are provided by Udacity from their [A/B testing course by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257).

See the Colab notebook for detailed analysis, and the PowerPoint Deck for a summary.
